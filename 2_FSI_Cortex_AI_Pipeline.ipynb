Also added here the native capabilities to process PDF files instead of PyPDF2.\n\n### AI Pipeline Overview\n\nWe'll learn how to extract raw text from a PDF, perform prompt engineering, and pass custom prompts and data to a large language model of our choosing all without leaving Snowflake.\n\nSpecifically, we will be taking on the role of an AI Engineer who is working closely with a portfolio team at an asset manager. The portfolio team would like to speed up their ingestion and comprehension of statements by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) who determines the direction of monetary policy by directing open market operations. Ultimately they would like to get a signal as to whether interest rates will increase, remain the same, or increase (hawkish, or, dovish respectively).\n\nI refer to this as an AI pipeline because we can imbue this type of signal generation with AI much further up the data delivery value chain. In this way, we will maximize the value of our work imbuing into a common dataset. End users will not need invoke any additional logic; good design is invisible!\n\n### Next Steps\n\n * To industrialize this demo with continuous ingestion and scoring, please check out the `FSI_Cortex_AI_Pipeline_Industrialization.ipynb` notebook in this repository\n * Check out the companion demo in this repository: `FSI_Cortex_Search.ipynb`"
